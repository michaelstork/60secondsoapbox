### 60secondsoapbox.io

60secondsoapbox.io is a web application which allows users to participate in the ALiEM 60 Second Soapbox podcast. Invited users can sign in with an invitation code, and record one minute of audio which is then released as part of the podcast.

The app features an in-browser recording interface which captures audio through the device's microphone using WebRTC. Recorded audio is then uploaded, processed, and can be previewed before submission. Submissions are handled by administrators through a simple back-end that allows for user management and content customization.
